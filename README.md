# Chat-Me
This is a basic Chat-App built with React-Native and Expo.

## Key Features

● A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.

●  A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.

● The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.

● Data gets stored online and offline.

## User Stories

● As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.

● As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.

● As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what I’m currently doing.

● As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.

● As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.

● As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
